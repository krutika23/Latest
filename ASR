 Voice User Interfaces represent a new generation of user interfaces, and theyâ€™re everywhere. We can find voice UI in mobile phones, TVs, smart home devices, and a range of other products

Among the many interactions that users can perform using voice, there is one that is especially important: voice search
 Voice interaction (and voice search in particular) will soon become either a valuable alternative or even a full replacement to traditional graphical user interfaces1. Design a more natural way of interaction

The ultimate goal of creating voice-enabled products is to allow people to interact with digital products more naturally and effectively.

Voice speeds up the process of interaction with a digital system because it allows people to interact with a system on their own terms
Voice-search is different from typical text searches not only in the way people formulate their queries
By using contextual suggestions, the system not only educates first-time users but also entices them to further engage with the device.

Hands-free interactions are the main benefit of using voice-enabled devices. Speaking a query or command aloud is supposed to be more frictionless than typing it
